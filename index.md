## Welcome to GitHub Pages

At the end of the project your website should include the following information:

Show it off: Describe the main idea of your project. What does your system do? Why would you want to do this? What are the major components to your system and how do they fit together? Hopefully you will have some cool videos to put in the website by this point.

System architecture: In detail describe each component of your project. Make sure to touch upon both code structure as well as algorithms.





## Guide 

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aramachandran7/micro_mouse_final/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aramachandran7/micro_mouse_final/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
